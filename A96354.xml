            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>For drawing the face, general Rules,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>IN this caſe curiouſly obſerve the face in its motion, whether upward, forward, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or ſide-ways, touching lightly the features, where the Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, and Chin ought to ſtand; then more perfectly go over them, for the Circles, Squares and Triangles, that are uſed in this matter, may ſerve well enough, to guide your Judgment where to place them. And in this caſe, obſerve diligently the principal Muſcles of a Face, appearing moſt in aged Men or Women. And there is uſual a threefold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153755:28"/>obſerved in a Face, as firſt from the top of the Fore-head to the Eye brows. Secondly, from the Brows to the bottom of the Noſe, and Thirdly, from thence to the bottom of the Chin, but in ſome the Fore-head is lower, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Noſe longer.</p>
                  <p>The diſtances between the Eyes conſiſt in a full Face of the length of one Eye, but in a three quarter, or ſide-face, that diſtance is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened anſwerable to the proportion. As for the Noſtril, it ought to be exactly placed againſt the corner of the Eye. And in a fat face, you will perceive the cheeks to ſwell, when on the contrary, in a lean face, the Jaw-bones ſtick out, and the cheeks fall in.</p>
                  <p>You may diſcern a ſmiling countenance, by perceiving the corners of the Mouth to turn up a little, and a frowning or ſowre countenance, by the Fore-heads bending and ſomewhat wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the top of the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>To draw a fore-right Face, make the form of a perfect Oval, divided into three equal parts, by two Lines. In the firſt part, place the Eyes: In the ſecond, the Noſtrils: And in the third, the Mouth, obſerving to keep the Eyes diſtant from each other, the length of one Eye, and that their inward corners be perfectly over the out ſide of the Noſtrils.</p>
                  <p>To draw an upright head, it muſt be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with three Lines, every way, either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, downwards, higher or lower, and that muſt, as the former, be divided into three equal parts.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:153755:28"/>
                  <p>To draw the Inclining, or fore-ſhortened face, obſerve how the Lines concord or agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with eaſe, you may draw, in their proper places, the Noſe, Mouth, and other parts, with a little Practice, and in theſe forms it is requiſite that you are very perfect as being rules of frequent uſe; for of the many parts of Man's Body, the face is moſt difficult; but having got the true proportion, with your meaſures, you will be capable, let the face turn which way it will, to form it; and further note, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever proportion the Face you are to imitate bears, your out ſtroaks muſt be formed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>As for the Noſe, it requires to its due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion much care and diligence, as being the moſt eminent part of the Face; in which, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, obſerve the hollowneſs, roundneſs, and indenting of the Noſtrils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing, eſpecially where the body is to be covered, is to be conſidered of the Hands, in their ſeveral poſtures and poſitions, as well by meaſure, as without, as alſo Hands, and Arms of whoſe poſtures, as well as the former, it would not be unneceſſary for the Learner, to get draughts for his better imitation, which may be had at moſt Picture Shops, for a ſmall matter ready done.</p>
                  <p>When you have practiſed, and are a little expert in drawing the Hands and Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the drawing of Feet in their ſeveral Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, as well without, as with meaſure;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153755:29"/>which having attained ſeparate, exerciſe your skill in drawing Legs and Feet conjunct or join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, that ſo underſtanding the frame and particulars of the whole body, you may be the better underſtanding in drawing the Figures in their due proportion and right Poſtures, in doing which there is no ſmall difficulty. And in this manner, having proceeded to form the Members, draw the other parts of the body, as the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Back, Breaſt, Belly, Secrets, Thighs, and the like, and laſtly take care in due proportion to join them, that they may appear firm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
                  <p>Coming to practiſe upon an entire body the beſt way is to begin with thoſe of Children; and my reaſon is, becauſe they are generally fat and plump, and rounder than the Bodies of Men and Women, and conſequently require ſo much curioſity in the obſervation of Muſcles and other Features, which render the drawing leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
                  <p>As for your further Direction in drawing, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ever to begin at the Head, and ſo proceed by degrees, running the whole lightly over at the firſt, and encreaſing more fully, as you ſee occaſion, ever being careful to take notice, that your parallel Joints, Muſcles, Sinews, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be rightly proportioned, and exactly oppoſite; alſo that the motions of the Body be anſwerable to each other, and that the Parts and Limbs have a due Symmetry, not being faulty in the indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of having one great Arm or Leg, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153755:29"/>ſmall one, nor a great Finger upon a ſmall Hand, neither further than the proportion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, ſuffer one Limb, or Member to be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than another; and although it ſo happen, which it frequently does, that at firſt you commit Errors of this nature, yet be not diſcouraged, for frequent practice will redreſs them.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far proceeded with Succeſs, and being indiſterent perfect herein, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what it is to ſhadow; and in this caſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the following Rules, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The out Lines of the draught of any Picture, give the ſymmetry or proportion, which ought to be ſufficient to a good Judgment, but the Lines and Shadows produce to the leſs curious, the lively likeneſs in ſhadowing; therefore of any Picture, you muſt take notice to caſt your ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow always one way, <hi>viz.</hi> on which ſide ſoever you begin to ſhadow your Figure, whether on the right or left Hand, as in the Figure of a Man, if you firſt proceed to ſhadow his left Cheek, the left ſide of his Neck, Body, and all other parts muſt be ſhadowed, unleſs the light ſide of the Figure be dark, by reaſon of ſome other Body ſtanding between the Light and it, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe three men were ſtanding together; then muſt the Body, or Figure in the middle be dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the foremoſt, unleſs the light by facing it come between them.</p>
                  <p>Further, note, that all ſhadows muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grow fainter, as they are further remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the opacous Body from whence they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153755:30"/>proceed. But in caſe of Storms, where Clouds, or Waves, by contending Winds are driven one againſt another, contrary ſhadows are allowed, as ſtriving for Superiority, and ſo you muſt be ſure to ſupply the greateſt firſt, and according to your Judgment, ſupply from them the leſſer.</p>
                  <p>All circular Bodies muſt have a circular ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as they have a circular form, and as the object of Light which cauſeth the ſhadow is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>And now for your further Information of this kind, obſerve that a Man ſtanding from the top of the head, to the bottom of the feet, is in due proportion eight times the length of the Head. The Arm when it hangeth ſtraight down, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth within a ſpan of the Knee; the Hand muſt be the length of the Face, and ſpread broad, muſt cover it, and no more; and further note, that in drawing a Figure ſtanding, you muſt in the firſt place draw that Leg, which the Body ſtands firm upon, or elſe your Figure will unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently decline one way more than another, as if it were falling. The Arms of a Man extended are his full length; and ſo of a Woman in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particulars. Thus having directed you in the drawing and proportioning naked Figures, I now proceed to give directions about Garments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in naked Figures, it is obſerved you draw the out-Lines firſt; ſo you muſt do in Drapery or Cloathing, leaving ſpace within for your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſer folds; then firſt draw the greater folds, and break them into leſſer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153755:30"/>contained within them, and the cloſer the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſits to the Body, the narrower and ſmaller muſt be the folds, and in ſhadowing, the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt muſt be the harder, and the outermoſt ſofter.</p>
                  <p>Continue always throughout your Garment the great folds, but as for the leſſer, break them off, as you ſee convenient, and the finer your drapery is, the fuller, and ſharper muſt your folds be, and the ſhadow the ſtronger, yet more pleaſant to the Eye, ever taking notice, that that part of any Garment that ſits cloſe, as the body Coat of a Man, the Breaſts of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the like, muſt not at all be folded, but rather with a ſweet ſhadow repreſent that part of the Body, that the Garment appears to cover, as Woman's Breaſts, with a ſweet found ſhadow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus much for the body of Man in drawing.</p>

               <p>A Landskip is that which giveth a pleaſant proſpect of Trees, Hills, Rivers, Cattle, and other Rural delights, with Towns, Cities,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153755:31"/>Caſtles, Promontories, Rocks, Ships, Boats, Barges, and whatever the fancy of that kind can form. To expreſs which, and make all truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear naturally, as they ought, according to the true proportion and diſtance, obſerve in every Landskip, to make a very fair Horizon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the Sky either clear, or over-caſt with Clouds, expreſſing the riſing or ſetting of the Sun, to iſſue as it were from or over ſome Hill, Mountain or Rock; but in a fair Landskip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware you expreſs not the Moon or Stars, which are only to be ſeen in a Night-piece; and in caſe, ſuch a piece be required, you may draw an Aſtronomer with his Quadrate, taking the height of the Moon, another with his Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, taking the diſtance of certain Stars, ſome ſtanding with a dark Lanthorn far from them, to give them knowledge of their degrees, an Owl flying in the Air, Men catching of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges with low Bells, a Woolf worrying of Sheep and the like, being natural to ſuch pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>If in any fair Landskip you expreſs the Light of the Sun, ever obſerve, that throughout your whole Piece, you caſt the Light of your Trees, Buildings, Rocks, Ruins, and all things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or expreſs'd within the work thither-ward: obſerve further to leſſen your Bodies proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, according to the nearneſs, or diſtance they ſhould naturally appear, ſo that the further the Landskip goeth from your Eye, the fainter you muſt expreſs any thing ſeen at diſtance, till

               </head>
               <p>HAving gone over that which we may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly term limning, or as many will have it drawing, I now come to that part, vulgarly known by the Appellation of Limning, <hi>viz.</hi> laying in water Colours the moſt curious of all, and much practiſed by Perſons of the beſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>To fit your ſelf, and prepare for the practice of this, you muſt have Gums of all ſorts to make your waters as occaſion requires; alſo a Marble flat ſtone, a Muller, Colours of various forts, liquid Gold and Silver, Size to lay Gold,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153755:32"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Parchment, of the fineſt pencils of ſundry ſorts, pots and Shells to put your Colours in.</p>
               <p>To make your Gum-water take Gum-arabick, white, clear, or tranſparent, for that which is yellow, or of an Amber-Colour is inſignificant; tie up a quantity in a rag, and hang it in fair water, till it be diſſolved; then the water being ſtiff enough for your purpoſe, mix your Colours with it, always having two ſorts to make a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker or ſtronger, as the matter requires.</p>
               <p>Gum-lake is a compound Gum, made of whites of Eggs, finely beat, Honey, Gum, of Ivy, ſtrong wort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being well mingled and beat together, they will run like Oil, and in the end harden, and this you may buy ready made, as the former, obſerving only, that it be clear and tranſparent.</p>
               <p>As for the Colours, there are ſimply ſix, <hi>viz.</hi> white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue, to which ſome add browns, but they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally compounded, and of either of theſe, there are ſeveral ſorts, as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Blacks the beſt, are burnt Ivory, Cherry-ſtones, Lamp-black. The whites are Ceruſs and white Lead. The reds are red Lead and Lake. The Blews are Indico, Ultramarine, Biſe-ſmalt. The Greens are biſe, Sap-green, Pink, Cedar-green. The yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows are Engliſh Oker and Maſticore. The Browns are Umber, Collens-earth, <hi>Spaniſh-</hi> brown.</p>
               <p>Theſe (though there are others) are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Colours in limning; and therefore, I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153755:32"/>chuſe to ſpeak of theſe only in this place, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers omitted, being fit only to colour Pictures or waſh Maps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of theſe</p>
               <p>The Colours to be waſhed are Biſe-ſmak, Cedar, Ultramarine, Maſticote, and red Lead. The Sap-green is only to be ſteeped, and the reſt I have meationed are to be waſhed and ground.</p>
               <p>To waſh Colours, you muſt put a quantity of the Colour intended into a clean earthen diſh, and pour water thereto very clear, ſtirring the Colour and water together, ſuffering it to ſtand a while, and perceiving the greaſe or ſcum to riſe, take it off, and pour out that water, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting other water to the Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo do, till the water become clear, and the Colour at the bottom remain fine; then pour away the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gently, and you will find the Colour ſticking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſides and edges of the diſh, as alſo at the bottom, and if it ſo happen, that you can get an ounce of pure Colour out of a pound (tho the reſt is ſerviceable for many uſes) it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>In ſteeping Sap-Green, you muſt put it only into fair water, adding a fourth part of Alum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder to raiſe the Colour, and at the end of twenty four hours it will be a curious green.</p>
               <p>As for the Colours that are to be waſhed and ground, take a ſmall quantity of either; and put it into a clean ſhell, adding a drop or two of Gum-water, and work it about the ſides of the ſhell with your finger, ſuffering it there to ſtick,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153755:33"/>till it is dry; then draw over it your Finger, and if any come off; then you muſt add more Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, but being dry, if it glitter or ſhine, it is a token there is too much Gum in it, which you muſt remedy, by tempering it up with fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Colours, as Umber and Lake, which parch and crack when they are dry, and therefore to bind them, you muſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them with fine Sugar-Candy diſſolved in fair water, and ſo you muſt do by other hard Colours ſubject to this defect.</p>
               <p>To burn the Colour thereto appropriated, put them into a crucible, cover it with a Lid of Clay, and ſet it on a hot fire, and ſuffer it to be red hot, and when the Colour is cold, you may waſh or grind it, as the Nature requires, but do neither before they be throughly burnt.</p>
               <p>To grind the Colours, I have directed ſo to be uſed, take a quantity of any of them clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from dirt and filth, and laying it upon your ſtone, bruiſe it a little with your Muller; and then with fair water grind it, till the Colour be very fine, then have in readineſs a large chalk ſtone with troughs, or furrows in it, and pour your Colour into it, and there ſuffer it to remain till it be well dry, at what time take it out, and reſerve it in Papers, or Boxes for your uſe—</p>
               <p>Of theſe ſix ſimple Colours, adding the brown, many may be compounded for faces of all Complexions, Garments, Land-skips, Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Rivers, Birds, Fiſh, Beaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As thus,</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:153755:33"/>
               <p>To make Violet Colour take Indico, white and Lake, and at pleaſure, you may, as you take more or leſs of a Colour make it lighter, or darker at Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Lead Colour, you may make of Indico, and white mixed and tempered together.</p>
               <p>Make Flame Colour, or Colour for flaming Fire of red Lead and Maſticote heightened with white.</p>
               <p>To make a ſcarlet Colour, take red Lead, Lake, and a ſmall quantity of Vermilion: For note, that the latter is not good in limning.</p>
               <p>To make light green, take Pink, and Smalt with white, to make it lighter, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires.</p>
               <p>To make a purple Colour, take Indico, Spaniſh brown, and white well tempered and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ightned</p>
               <p>To make a Bay Colour, take only <hi>Spaniſh</hi> brown and white.</p>
               <p>To make a Murrrey Colour, take Lake and white.</p>
               <p>Many other Colours are made by mixture, too tedious here to be recited; wherefore, I leave them to the diſcretion of the Practitioner, to mix them ſuitable to his work or fancy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the practical part of this curious Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>WHen you have prepared your Colours, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare likewiſe good Pencils, to know them, draw them wet through your Mouth, and if they come to a hair, or ſharp point, they are good, but if they after that ſtand rough, or hairs ſtare, or ſtart out at the ſide, they are nought, and to be rejected.</p>
               <p>The next thing is to prepare your Table; and in this caſe, get a fine Paſte-board ſleeked as ſmooth as a Card; then fine Parchment or Vellum, and ſtarch it upon the board, as ſmooth and even, that no wrinkle, or riſing may appear; to perfect which, you muſt lay the Parchment ſide on your Stone rubbed very clean, and poliſh the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, and ſo let it dry in the ſhade.</p>

And if you are to draw the Picture of any live Perſon, the poſture being agreed upon, ſuffer him or her to ſit above two yards diſtant from you, and as level with you as may be, marking well, that whenſoever the Party moves, though never ſo little, for never ſo little motion of the Body or Face, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, may occaſion in a ſhort time many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and when you undertake this, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Materials are requiſite to be near you, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two ſmall diſhes or ſawcers with clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the one to waſh your Pencils in when foul, and the other to tamper your Colours withal; a fine large Pencil to cleanſe your work, called a Fitch-pencil; a ſharp Pen-knife to take off hairs, coming from your Pencil or Spots, that may fall upon your Card; a Paper having holes cut therein, to lay upon your Card, to cover it from duſt, and to reſt your Hand upon.</p>
               <p>If your Carnation, or fleſh Colour be temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, it muſt be ſomewhat lighter, than the Complexion of the Party you are to draw. If it be a fair Complexion, you muſt have white Lead, and red Lead well tampered. If the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153755:35"/>Complexion be ſwarthy or brown, add to your white and red Lead, Maſticote, or Engliſh O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or both, if occaſion require it; but let the Complexion be what it will, be ſure to tamper your Fleſh Colour lighter than the Party to be drawn; for if it be too ſad, there is no remedy; and obſerve to place your Shadows diſtinct from each other in a large ſhell: And note, that in all your Shadows, you muſt uſe ſome white, wherefore in the firſt place, lay a conſiderable quantity of white by it ſelf, over and above what the ſhadows are at firſt tempered withal. In the ſecond place, for red uſual to the cheeks, and Lips, tamper Lake, and red Lead. In the third place, for your blue ſhadows, as Veins, or under the Eyes, take Indico and white. In the fourth place, for your faintiſh green ſhadow, take Engliſh Oker, White, and Indico, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Maſticote. In the fifth place, for a deep ſhadow, take white, and Engliſh Oker, and Umber. Sixthly, for Dark ſhadows, in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Men, take Lake and Pink, for they make an excellent fleſhy ſhadow. And theſe being the chief ſhadows, I leave what may further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr of this kind to your diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Having all things in readineſs, the next thing you proceed to, is to draw the face, in doing which; take the following method, <hi>viz.</hi> lay the ground, with the Colour anſwerable to the Complexion of the Party; and then begin the draught, the Party ſitting. Now to finiſh a Face three Operations of ſitting are required. At
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153755:35"/>the firſt ſitting, you muſt only lay the dead Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour At the ſecond, go over the Face more curiouſly, nearly obſerving whatſoever may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Grace, or Deformity of the Perſon to be drawn, conſidering it in a ſweet diſpoſe, and well couching the Colours one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in this ſitting, you perfect what on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was rough before, by laying on the deep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, ſo that at the third ſitting, you may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Face, as in the Eyes, Eye-brows, Hair, and Ears, which things are the laſt work, and not to be perfected, till the Hair, Curtain, or Back-ſide of the Picture, as alſo the Drapery be finiſhed. And of theſe ſittings in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <p>Having laid your ground for the general Complexion, the next work muſt be to draw the out Lines, which you muſt effect with Lake, and white mingled drawing very faintly; ſo that if you chance to miſs your proportion, you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it with a deeper mixture of the ſame Colour.</p>
                  <p>Having drawn the proportion of the Face, add to the former Colour a ſmall proportion of red Lead, tempering it faintly to the Colour of the Cheeks, and Lips, at the tips of the Chin, and Ears, about the Eyes, and the roots of the Hair, placing the red ſhadows, and as for the ſhadows, they muſt not be put in with the flat of the Pencil, but with ſmall touches after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153755:36"/>of hatching, and in this manner going over the Faces, you will cover your ground with theſe and the like Shadows, and in theſe dead Colours, your curioſity need not be great, only ſtrive to imitate Nature, as near, as may be, for the roughneſs of the Colours may be mended at the ſecond Operation.</p>
                  <p>Having duly placed, and proportioned your red ſhadows; in the next place, put in your faint blue ſhadows about the Corners of the Eyes, and Balls, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and your greyiſh blue under the Eyes, and about the Temples, working them ſweetly and faintly over by degrees, heightning the ſhadow, as the Light falls; as likewiſe the hard ſhadows in the dark ſide of the Face un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eye brows, Noſe, Chin, and Neck, with ſome ſtronger touches on thoſe places, than on the light ſide of the Face, and ſo bring all your work together to an equal roundneſs, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perfection to no particular Part, at this time, but take a ful view of your object; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how near you hit the Life, not only in ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likeneſs but roundneſs, boldneſs of Poſture, colouring, and ſuch like.

                  <p>In this ſitting, the party muſt take the ſame Place, and Poſture, as before, and then be curious to delineate with your Pencil, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular varieties of Nature; and as you drew them over but rudely before, you now muſt ſweeten them with the ſame Colours, by working, and driving them one into another; ſo that no rough edge, nor lump of Colour may appear, and this muſt be done, with a Pencil ſharper than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by which means the ſhadow may be ſoft and ſmooth.</p>
                  <p>Thus having done, proceed to the back-ſide of your Picture, and if there a Curtain, as is the uſual manner, be required, we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be blue Sattin, and to do it, temper as much Biſe in a ſhell, as will cover a ſmall Card, ſuffering it to be moiſt and well bound with Gum; then draw with your Pencil the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of your Curtain, as alſo of your Picture, and ſo lay it over very thin, and airy with a large Pencil, that it may be the whole ground, you intend to do with blue; and then lay it over again with a ſubſtantial body of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; in doing which, you muſt be ſwift, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Colour moiſt, and not ſuffering any part to be dry till all be covered.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:153755:37"/>
                  <p>If it happen that your Curtain is to be Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you muſt trace it out with Lake, and lay the ground with a thin Colour, obſerving where your ſtrong Lights and Reflections fall, there lay the Lights with a thin, and wateriſh Colour, and the Ground being yet wet, lay the ſtrong and hard ſhadows cloſe by the other Lights, with a dark Colour temper'd reaſonably thick.</p>
                  <p>Thus having layed your back-ſide, which in the ſame manner you may do with any Colour. Your next work is, to lay your Linen of a fair white, and your Drapery flat with the Colour you intend it. Then take another view of the Face, and mark well what ſhadows are too light, or too deep, and endeavour to reduce each ſhadow to its due Perfection; then ſhadow the enterance into the Ear, and draw the Lines of the Eye lid, the deepneſs of the Eye brows, and all the moſt eminent Notes and Marks in the Face, doing them with a very curious ſharp Pencil, and then heighten the Hair, deepening it, as it appears in the Life, caſting over the ground ſome looſe Hairs, which will look very pleaſant, and make the Picture ſeem to ſtand at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Curtain.</p>
                  <p>In the ſhadowing your Linen, which ought to be very curious, uſe black, white, a little yellow, and a ſmall quantity of blue. The black being deepened with Ivory-black; to which add a ſmall quantity of lake, or Indico: And thus much for the ſecond Operation, from whence I proceed to the third and laſt.</p>

                  <p>In caſe of Ornaments, as Garments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ground being laid with Biſe; then the deepening muſt be Lake, and Indico, the Lightning, white, very fine, faint and fair; and in the extreme light places, let what has been ſaid of the blue Drapery ſuffice, and may be underſtood of all other Colours; and for the greater Ornament, you may mix the Light with Gold, or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>In this caſe, always begin with the Sun Beams and Sky, the lighteſt part firſt; and then the yellow, which muſt be compoſed of Maſticote, and white, the next your blue Skies with Smalt only leaving no part of your ground at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but lay the Colours ſmooth all over, working the Sky downward toward the Horiſon, ſtill ſuffering it to grow faint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it draws nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Earth, and work the tops of Mountains, and other objects very remote, ſo faint, that they may appear, as loſt in the Air, and as for your loweſt and neareſt ground, it muſt be an Earth Colour of dark brown, inclining a little to yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh, and green, as the matter requires, and the next a lighter green, and ſo ſucceſſively, as they loſe in their diſtance, you muſt abate their Colour, nor muſt you make any thing, you ſee at a great diſtance, perfect, or abſolute, what it really is; becauſe it is altogether conjecture, you cannot abſolutely diſcern it, but expreſs it in Colours weakly, and faintly, as your Eye judges it may be. And ever obſerve in this caſe to place the light againſt the dark; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the contrary, which is an excellent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:153755:38"/>way, to extend the Proſpect far off, yet do it ſo, as the ſhadows may loſe in their proportion of diſtance, by degrees, their force, as they remove from the Eye, obſerving further, that the ſtrongeſt ſhadow muſt ever be neareſt. And thus much may ſuffice for limning in water Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which if duly obſerved, and practiſed, will wonderfully help the Learner: And in this manner, you may paint upon Glaſs, by laying on the faireſt Colours if it appear through the Glaſs firſt; but if otherwiſe, lay firſt a ground, and eſpecially upon Copper.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AS this Noble Science, in all Ages, has been held in much Eſteem, and Veneration among Men, in all Ages, it is now more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153755:39"/>covered to be known, and practiſed, by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex; wherefore for the better Inſtruction, eſpecially of the Learner, I have thought fit to lay down the following plain, and eaſie rules, which being well obſerved, and practiſed, may in time bring him to be a great Maſter in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But firſt, of the Colours to be uſed on this occaſion, without knowing which, the reſt may prove ineffectual.</p>
               <p>The blacks are Lamp-black. Sea coal-black, Char-coal black, Ivory-black, and Earth of Collen. The white white Lead only The greens, Verdegreaſe, Terra-yert, and Verditer. The yellows are Pink, Maſticote, Orpiment, Spruce Oker, Engliſh Oker. The blues are Biſe, Smalt, Indico, and Ultramarine. The reds are Vermilion, red Lead, Indian red, Lake, and Ornotto. The Colours indifferent are Spaniſh brown, burnt Spruce, and Umber.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal Colours to be laid in Oil, and muſt for the greateſt part of them be ground upon your flat ſtone with a Muller, with Line-ſeed Oil, though as for Ivory, Spruce, Oker, and Umber, they muſt be burnt before they are ground. And as for Maſticote, Ultra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine, Verditer, Vermilion, Lamp-black, Smalt, and Orpiment, you may temper them upon your Pallet with Oil, ſaving your ſelf the labour of grinding, &amp;c. and as for thoſe, that are to be burnt you muſt perform it in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and though Line-ſeed Oil be common to all, yet in caſe, with your white Lead; you are to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:153755:39"/>lay Linen, you muſt mix it with Oil of Wall nuts by reaſon the other will in a ſhort time turn yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh.</p>
               <p>The next thing, you are to take care of, is to have good Pencils of all ſizes, a Pallet, or Board, to lay your Colours on, whilſt you are uſing them, and an Eyſil to lay your Cloth upon, or againſt, and a ſtraining Frame, to which it muſt be nailed, and you muſt further have a Stay or Moleſtick, which is made of Braziel, or ſuch Wood, as will not eaſily bend, about a yard long, at one end of which, tie a ball of Cotton in a piece of Leather; ſo that holding it in your left hand againſt the work, you may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port your right Arm with it, whilſt you are working; and being thus furniſhed, you may proceed to the work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And firſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>For a fair Complexion.</head>
                  <p>Take a ſmall quantity of white, and twice as much Vermilion, and Lake, temper theſe with the flat of a Knife's Blade upon your Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, or Hand-board, and uſe it for the deepeſt Carnation of the Face, adding moreover to a ſmall part of it more white, and reſerve that for a lighter Carnation. And yet another part being reſerved, add more white to it, till it come to the lighteſt Colour in the Face: And then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to prepare the faint ſhadows, and in doing it.</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:153755:40"/>
                  <p>Take Smalt, and mix it with a little white, which may conveniently ſerve for the Eyes; then laying aſide the greateſt quantity, add to the reſt a little Pink, and theſe well tempered, will ſerve for the faint greeniſh ſhadow in the Face; then proceed to prepare your deep ſhadows: And in order to it, take Lake, Pink, and Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-black a like quantity of each, and temper them together. And if the Face of the Party, or the Figure you are to copy require redder ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, than what you have tempered, add more Lake, if yellower, more Pink, if bluer, or grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then add more black.</p>

                  <p>For a tawny Complexion, uſe the ſame, in the general, as before, only let the ſhadows be prepared of burnt Oker, and Umber.</p>
                  <p>For an abſolute black Complexion, your dark ſhadow muſt be as the fore going, but as for your heightnings, you muſt take burnt Oker, Lake, with black and white, yet but a little of

               <p>YOur Pencils, how ſmall ſoever, ought to have a ſtick about nine inches long, cut, or ſharpened at the fartheſt end into a point, and when you are to draw any Face, lay together two Ducks Quills Fitch-Pencils, two Gooſe Quill fitch'd, two pointed, and two briſtled, the pairs being exactly alike; and when you are to uſe them, having your Pallet in a readineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your thumb, take them in your right Hand, and put the ends of your ſticks into your left Hand, keeping when you work the hairy ends, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance leſt the Colours intermingle, &amp; ſo proceed to your work, <hi>viz.</hi> your Cloth being ready prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtrained upon your Frame, ſcrape it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153755:41"/>over with a Knifes edge, not very ſharp, to take off the knots, if any appear, and ſo ſet your Frame and Cloth upon your Eyſel a convenient height, ſo that you ſitting upon a Stool level with the Party or Copy you draw, may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have the Picture equal, &amp;c. placing it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Light, as I have directed in Water-limning; then with a piece of Chalk draw the proportion of the Face upon the Cloth, making the place for the Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, Ears, Hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then take a Swans Quill pointed Pencil, and begin with ſome of the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Colours in the lighteſt part of the Face (the Cloth before being primed, or ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid) as the heightning of the Fore-head, Cheek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, Noſe, &amp;c. on the lighteſt ſide, and when you have done that, next proceed to the mean parts, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe not altogether ſo light, as the Cheek bone of the fore-ſhortning, or dark ſide, the Chin and upper Lip and by degrees come to the reddeſt part of all.</p>
               <p>Having thus far proceeded, lay the greeniſh faint ſhadows in places convenient, and where you ſee cauſe, to moderate the harder ſhadows; but have eſpecial regard not to place the green, where the red ſhould be: And ſo, all the faint, and light beginnings being put in, take a Ducks Quill fitch'd, and a Gooſe-Quill pointed Pencil, and begin at the Eyes to ſhadow with Lake, and trace out thoſe parts of the Face therewith, that require it, as the Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, the compaſs of the Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153755:41"/>this before you lay on any Colour, lightly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it over with a linen rag, to prevent theover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of other Colours.</p>
               <p>Having now put in all the Colours, dark, and light, take a large fitched Pencil, and ſweeten the Colours: That is, go over the ſeveral ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows with a clean, ſoft Pencil, which by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and dexterous handling, will force, or drive the Colours into each other; ſo that they will repreſent the laying on at once, and not at ſeveral times. This being done, begin again with your clean Pencils of ſuch bigneſs, as the work requires; then, the Party ſitting in the poſture as before, take a curious view, and ſee what defects you find in the work, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them; after that proceed to heighten, or deepen your ſhadows, as the Nature of the piece requires, and if a Beard, or Hair be required, take a Gooſe Quill briſtle Pencil, and put in the Hair about the Face, and rub in the greater Hair, with the greater Briſtle, heightning it up with your Gooſe-quill Pencil, and ſo your work is done.</p>
               <p>If Garments are required, called by Artiſts Drapery, For a red Garment, lay dead Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with Vermilion, glaze it over with Lake, and heighten it with white. For Scarlet, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion muſt be the lighteſt, deepened with Lake, or Indian red. For a crimſon Velvet, lay burnt Oker, Vermilion, or Indian red, glaze it with Lake, and touch it up with Vermilion. For a ſad red, heighten Indian red with white, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153755:42"/>let all your deepenings be with black, Pink, and Lake well tempered. For green Garments, heighten Biſe and Pink with Maſticote, and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it with Indico and Pink. For green Velvet, lay the dead Colour with white, and a little Lamp black, glaze it with Verdegreaſe, deepen it with Indico and Pink, and heighten it with Pink and white. For yellow, take yellow O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Maſticote, and Umber, lay the dead Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with Maſticote, and white, in the higheſt Places, and with white, and Oker in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and with Umber in the darkeſt, glazing it when dry with Pink.</p>
               <p>For blue Garments, take Indico, and white, laying firſt the white in its due Places; and then your mean Colour, <hi>viz.</hi> Indico, and white well tempered in their due places; then deepen it with Indico, and glaze it with Ultramarine when dry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>For purple Garments, take Oil ſmall temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Lake, and white Lead, and heighten it with the latter.</p>
               <p>For black Garments, let the dead Colour be Lamp-black, and a little Verdegreaſe, and when it is dry, go over it with Ivory-black, and having heightned it with white, go over it with Ivory black, and Verdegreaſe.</p>
               <p>For Orange Colour Garments, mix red Lead, and Lake, laying the lighteſt parts with red Lead, and white; the mean parts with only red Lead, and the deeper with Lake, and if need requires you may heighten it with white.</p>

               <head>CHAP.

               <p>TO introduce this curious Art, I think it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convenient to begin with etching, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to give a light into what ſucceeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and firſt of the Ground.</p>
               <p>In this caſe, procure three parts of Virgins wax, and one of Aſphaltum, one part of Maſtick, and one part of clarified Roſin, but all but the Wax, putting that into a new glazed Pipkin, or Pan, and let it boil over a gentle Fire, at what time, put the other Ingredients to it, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:153755:43"/>being melted, pour it out into fair cold water, keeping back the dregs; and when it is cold, work it into a ball; tie it then in a rag, ſo cloſe, that no dregs may come through, and uſe it upon your Copper, as you have occaſion.</p>
               <p>In preparing your Copper, obſerve that it be well poliſhed, not lying higher in one place than another, nor no where uneven, and if you eſpy and ſpecks or diſorders in it, coal it over with a well burnt Char-coal, and fair water, and ſet it aſlope to dry, which done, ſcrape ſome very dry Chalk or Whitening upon it, and rub it over with a woollen rag, not touching the Face of the Plate with your finger, till the ground be laid, which muſt be done in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:153755:44"/>have a regard to true drawing; wherefore, I would adviſe the unskilful well to conſider what I have laid down of that kind, and ſo provide himſelf with materials for the performance of this curious Art.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, be ſure to chooſe a good Oil ſtone free from pin-holes, or flaws, not too hard, nor too ſoft; and therefore the better to furniſh your ſelf aright, you muſt conſult, in what the ſtreſs of your buſineſs will lie; for if you intend Picture, or Letter work, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more curious than Marks, or Arms uſed by Gold-ſmiths, and Pewterers, you muſt have your Gravers accordingly ſhaped, and tempered, for Gold-ſmiths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gravers are frequently crooked, the better to come at hollow places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for Copper, or any Plate, that may be eaſily come at, the ſtrait Gravers are ever held the beſt, and if you ſuſpect their goodneſs, try whether, or not, they are file proof; and if ſo, they will fit your purpoſe, though at firſt, by reaſon of their temper, they may appear brittle, and ſometimes break ſhort, yet being ground out, they will ſtill grow better and better, and come in a little time to an excellent temper.</p>
               <p>As for the forms of Gravers, as to their uſe, the ſquare one makes a broad ſhadow ſtroak, or hatch and that which is, form Lozenge, a narrow deep one, the one being appropriated to large, and the other to fine ſtroaks, yet if your work be curious, a middle ſize between theſe will the better accomodate you, which will render
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:153755:45"/>your ſtroaks, or hatches more graceful, and yet carry with them ſufficient force and vigor.</p>
               <p>In caſe of whetting your Gravers, which is frequently required, pour a little fine Olive Oil upon your ſtone, and laying that ſide, which you intend ſhall cut the Copper flat upon it, whet it very flat, and even, and to that purpoſe, carry your hand very ſteady, continuing an equal ſtrength, and placing your fore finger firm upon the contrary ſide, ſo that you may have more power to guide it with exactneſs; then turn the unwhetted ſide, and uſe it in the ſame form and manner, that there may be a very ſharp edge; then turning uppermoſt that edge, which in the former manner you have whetted, ſetting the end of your Graver obliquely upon the ſtone, bear your hand with an exact evenneſs, to the intent it may prove very flat, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oping in the form of a Lozenge; and in this, you muſt take great care, for if your Graver be not well, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whetted, you can never grave well.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, when you have a Graver, whoſe handle is a round, or oval knob, if you would prevent it from running into the Copper, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther metal you grave, further than is convenient; then muſt you cut off that part of the knob, which lies in a Line with the point of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and make it as level as you can with the point; nor then will it hinder your Hand from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying an even ſtroak, which otherwiſe it will do, eſpecially in working a great Plate, by bearing too much upon the Copper, and in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:153755:45"/>it, place the knob-ſide, or that part of the Ball not cut off in the hollow of your Hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending your fore-finger towards the point, and laying it oppoſite to the edge, that is to cut, and place your other fingers on the one ſide of the handle, and your thumb on the other ſide of the Graver, in ſuch a manner, as with eaſe you may guide it flat and parallel with the Plate, being ever very careful, that you fingers do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe between the Plate, and Graver, leſt it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you in carrying it level with the Plate, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering you from making your ſtroaks with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and neatneſs.</p>
               <p>Further to fix you in this affair, you muſt have a ſtrong round Cuſhion of Leather filled with fine Sand, about half a foot over, and four inches in the Diameter, riſing a little in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and ſloping towards the brims, but not much, and this muſt be to lay your Plate on, that you may turn it at leiſure; and if you are to make ſtreight ſtroaks, hold your Graver in a direct Line: Or in caſe you would have your ſtroaks broader, and deeper in one place than in another, you muſt lay more or leſs ſtreſs, as you ſee occaſion, obſerving in all ſtreight ſtroaks, to hold your Plate ſteady, and firm upon the Cuſhion, and the Table, or Bank on which it ſtands well fixed: But in crooked, and winding ſtroaks, you muſt hold your Hand, and Graver ſteadfaſt, and only turn your Plate, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways you cannot command your Hand to that neatneſs, as in many caſes is required, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:153755:46"/>at the ſame time, for the more ſteadineſs to keep your Elbow fixed upon the Table, and your Eye on the Plate, ſcraping your work, as you go with the edge of a burniſher to take off the roughneſs; yet be careful that you make no ſcratches, and the better to ſee what you have done, rub the place over with a piece of black felt dipped in Oil; and then if any ſcratches ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, with your burniſher rub them out, and if any ſtroaks be too hard, in the ſame manner you may make them fainter. And in caſe your Graver ſhould happen to appear very hard, which by its exceſſive brittleneſs in often breaking is known, lay it upon a burning Charcoal, till it grow yellow; and then dip it in water, and it will by often ſo doing render it of a better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but if it be blunt in a ſhort time cutting, then it is too ſoft, and you muſt heat it in the fire, and dip it in Lime juice, or Vinegar: And thus much for the management of the Tools. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the which by a little practice will ſoon grow natural.</p>
               <p>Another material thing in Art is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; which is, to take the Impreſſion you are to cut, or grave upon your Plate; and in this caſe, heat your Plate over a fire of Small-coal, and having a piece of fine Bees-wax tyed up in a fine rag, worked like a ball, that it may ſit cloſe, wipe the Plate over with it, when it is hot enough, very lightly, till you perceive it is covered with wax, very thin, and even, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a feather, in which, at firſt you may find ſome difficulty, but uſe will render it eaſie,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:153755:46"/>and in this caſe, if you are to imitate an exact Copy, it muſt be ſo ordered, that it may ſtand the contrary way on the Plate; and therefore in conſideration hereof, your beſt way will be to track it over with a black Lead Pencil; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in caſe of a very old Picture, which being done, take a piece of poliſhed Ivory, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing your Picture exactly on your Plate the Print fide downward, rub it lightly, and you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the exact proportion of the Print remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Wax, or the Plate; then take a ſteel point, and go over each particular Limb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially in the out ſtroaks, and there will be but little difficulty to mark the ſhadows which he before you, as you engrave the Work, and the readier it will be, if ſo you note how far your ſhadows ſhould be dark, and how far light, with your black Lead before you rub it off.</p>
               <p>The carrying of the hand in this kind, will at firſt ſeem difficult, as to the depth of your ſtroaks; but in general, obſerve ever to carry your hand with ſuch a ſlight, that you may end with the ſame faintneſs, or darkneſs you begin: And in caſe, one part require more deepneſs, and blackneſs than another, you muſt do that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and that you may the more expertly do it, obſerve that your ſtroaks be not too cloſe, nor too wide; and therefore to bring your hand in the better, practiſe at firſt by ſuch Prints, as are but looſly ſhadowed, leaſt by attempting to imitate thoſe more dark and cloſe, you happen to be puzzled where to begin, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:153755:47"/>where to end, but practice will inform you.</p>
               <p>As for Letters; in caſe of Copies, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt be gone over with ungumed Ink, or with black Lead, and laid on the Plate when waxed as the former, unleſs you are ſo dexterous at writing, that you can draw them by hand, or with a ſteel point on the Plate in true Cut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if a Map, or other Mathematical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be required, every circle, or perpendicular muſt be drawn over as before, or you cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly imitate. But in caſe of a face, or coat of Arms, or Inſtruments not to be printed; then you may black over the back-ſide, as in etching, but you muſt uſe for engraving a wax ground only.</p>

                  <p>To make a curious green, take the juice of rue, and a little Verdigreaſe.</p>
                  <p>For a light green, take Sap green flower de Biſs, or tawny green, and ſteep them in fair water.</p>

               <p>IN caſe of Minerals, and all things inanimate, concenter'd, or contained in the Bowels of the Earth, it is convenient to reduce them to four kinds of Mixtures, viz. Metals, Stones, Earth, or Juices, Nature producing them with mixture, and participation of each o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her, and here by Earth. I mean the ſimple Element only, of which, as the Philoſophers affirm, all ſublunary Bodies are compounded, and though the Earth,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153755:53"/>according to the ſituations of Countries, and differences of Climes, differs in Scent, Colour and Taſte; yet that proceeds from a mixture of ſome other part, or effect of the former; the pure Elementary Earth being in all places one and the ſame; in which, and by the operation of heat and moiſture, the others are generated; and as there are more or leſs of theſe, the Metals are finer or courſer: But to come nearer to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Gold is found in Grains, or Sand; and Silver in veins, and ſometimes twiſted, and wreathed like the branches of a Vine, and at other times theſe Metals are found in ſtones, with whoſe hardneſs, they have incorporated themſelves, and being broken, are with fining materials ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. As for Gold; it is the moſt perfect of all inanimate bodies, and has its Generation, as I have ſaid from heat, and moiſture in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; but of Parts ſo well contracted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by Concoction, that it is in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, it being beyond the Power of any Element to prejudice, or deſtroy it; for the Fire of the moſt ſubtle, and piercing Quality, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming all other Metals by long Application, renders Gold more pure, nor can the Air, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Earth diminiſh its luſter; but that it will again recover it, by which means, it has deſerved the Eſtimation the World affords it; and is ſo ductil, that being expanded, an ounce of pure Gold will cover a place of twenty, or thirty feet ſquare.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:153755:54"/>
               <p>Silver as is hinted, carries a fineneſs next to Gold, wanting little more than the Colour, to be brought to its perfection; wherefore thoſe that ſtrongly inveigh againſt the tranſmutation of Metals, have been convinced, that there is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to turn Silver into Gold, by reaſon Fire and artificial concoctions may ſupply the defect, of which there have been many Experiments, and from the even mixture, good temperature, and fineneſs of its parts, it is not only ductil, and malleable, but endures the Fire with little waſte, and admirable it is, that an ounce of fine Silver may be drawn out into a thouſand four hundred yards, and that too, for the moſt part without breaking; and all this extenſion may be gilded with ſix grains of Gold.</p>
               <p>Copper is a metal to the compoſition whereof, a great quantity of Sulphur is required, and from a diſtempered heat in the mixture, the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heat proceeds, and being over burnt in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it is therefore leſs ſubject to Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and is uſed about Engines of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, becauſe it ruſteth not, and is found in Mineral Stones of divers colours, though the moſt effectual Colour is green, or blue, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is it ingendred near Gold, and Silver, that many times following a vein of it, much pure Gold, and oftener Silver has been found; and ſuch Veins of Copper, as make a ſuperficial ſhew, are upon being digged, richer the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per you go, and that is occaſioned by the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and many times pure Silver is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

As for its extraordinary hardneſs from over much Earthy parts, or fixed Sulphur in its compoſition; not, but it has a proportion of Quick ſilver in it, ſo that it will not without a very violent heat be melted, nor will it break, but expand by force of hammers, or other Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and receive an impreſſion by dilating it ſelf; and although it is cold and dry, yet by reaſon it is more porous than other Metals, it is of leſs weight; and conſequently ſubject to be conſumed by ruſt.</p>
               <p>Lead is frequently found in the Silver Mines, and indeed as often by it ſelf, nor ſcarcely is there any ore, but ſome quantity of Lead is found in its mixture, as being by the abundance of its humidity ſerviceable to it; and eſpecially in the melting of Gold, and Silver, which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be done without the help of Lead; for in this caſe, by reaſon of its moiſture, it does eaſily evaporate, carrying with it whatever is not Gold, or Silver, and in its weight comes neareſt to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Gold, and in Colour to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not being ſubject to Corruption, as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
               <p>Tin is begotten, or generated by a groſſer fore of indigeſted Quick ſilver, though much finer than Lead, by which means, it becomes more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:153755:55"/>white, and hard, though from the ill mixture of its ſubſtance, it is accounted the Bane of Metals making them brittle by never ſo ſmall a mixture; and the reaſon is, that by its incorporation, it hinders the ductility, and diſorders its former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual temperature; except in Lead, with which it better agrees, by reaſon of the moiſture, and ſoftneſs; ſo that being incorporated they become ductil, and malleable.</p>
               <p>Quick-ſilver is of a liquid penetrating Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and greatly in uſe; eſpecially in refining Metals, agreeing with any ſort, abounding with much humidity; which gives it brightneſs and weight, and is held the principal of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all Metals; nay its very ſubſtance is tranſmutable into Metals, enduring as well, as thoſe that come out of the Mines, the trial of the Fire, and Hammer.</p>
               <p>There are ſundry Metals, called Artificial Metals, made by mixture of Minerals. As from a mixture of Tin, and Copper, Braſs, or Bell-metal is made; as alſo for pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſundry other uſes: and in this caſe, a pound of Tin muſt be put from four, to eight pound of Copper, according as you expect it brittler, or tougher.</p>

               <p>HAving briefly run over ſundry matters relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Metals and Minerals, I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to come ſomewhat nearer their true value,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:153755:60"/>as by the rules of Art, they are laid down by curious Inquirers into thoſe Affairs, &amp;c. eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to what relates to Metals, uſed in Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of value, and current in Coins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the principal. I take to be Gold, and Silver; the reſt being vulgarly known, and therefore not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be mentioned in this Place.</p>
               <p>As for the weight uſed for theſe fine Metals, it is that of <hi>Troy,</hi> conſiſting of twelve ounces; and the ounce of a hundred and fifty Carots, and may again for the deciding of leſſer values be devided into four hundred, and eighty Grains; as for the Pound <hi>Troy</hi> weight of fine God, it is worth thirty ſix pounds, and ſo leſſens in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Allay, in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> an ounce of fine Gold is valued at three pounds; and that of thirty three keys fine, at two pounds ſeventeen ſhillings ſix-pence; and ſo leſſening, <hi>viz.</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Keys, at two pound fifteen ſhillings, twenty one Keys, at two pound twelve Shillings ſix pence, at twenty Keys, two pound ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, looſing two ſhillings ſix peace <hi>per</hi> ounce, as a Key, or Carot is wanting in the fineneſs of twenty four.</p>
               <p>In this caſe, to know the fineneſs, or defect, it muſt to prevent defraud be found out by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, which upon the touch-ſtone may be done by way of Eſſay in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> take Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of Gold, and Silver, and Copper allay, ſuitable to the ſeveral allays, and ſuffer theſe to be of four ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt to be of fine Gold, and Silver: The ſecond of Gold, and Copper.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:153755:61"/>the third of Gold, Silver, and Copper. And the fourth of Silver, and Copper only; the firſt for the trial of Gold; and the latter for the trial of Silver, making of theſe mixtures twenty four Needles of ſundry fineneſſes. As firſt of fine Gold of twenty four Carots without Allay. The ſecond twenty three Carots of fine Gold, and one of Silver. The third twenty two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots of Gold, and two of Silver; and ſo proceed to one Carot worſe, till there remains but one Carot of the fine Gold in mixture with the other Metals ſpecified, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> twenty three Carots of Silver, and by the ſame rule proceed to the Gold and Copper, and Silver and Copper, marking each Needle for the better diſtinction upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of what fineneſs it is; and by this way, you may be ſatisfied of the fineneſs of any Ingot, or piece of Gold or Silver in Coin or otherways by comparing them on your Touch-ſtone with the Needle, whoſe allay you already know, or try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, till they become equal or alike, which when wetted will plainly appear. As for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Silver, that which is fine is accounted five ſhillings two pence of our Money the ounce, though there is ſome that will fall out in fineneſs, to be worth five and eight pence, and the like. But theſe Eſſays not being to be done by every Perſon who receives Money, I ſhall by other ways inſtruct them how they may detect coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Coins.</p>

               <p>Paſt doubt, few that have the handling of Money are ignorant, that Coins of all ſorts have been counterfeit, ſome by imbaſing in mixture, others by corrupt Metals, and other by way of plating; and to know theſe; in caſe of Guinneas or broad Gold, Firſt, weigh them, and try them by Eſſay as aforeſaid; and then if you further ſuſpect them, try them by Fire, or by Aqua fortis; and if they be of baſe Metal, or corrupted with is, they will ſoon grow dim, and their Luſtre in a ſmall time more and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; but if you ſuſpect them plated, eſpecially Guinneas, throw them indifferent hard on the edge, and the Imboſsment will open, and you may diſcover the ſhell to riſe. In caſe of gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Shillings, though they have the Scepters as Guinneas, which ſome Perſons have had the Art to place there with graving Tools; yet your beſt way is to try them by racing with a Pen-knife point in any convenient Place; and although they are double gilded, the Silver will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>The counterfeit Milled is waſhed over or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and to diſcover this, you will find the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters imperfect, or perhaps none upon the edges of Crowns or half Crowns; the ſound likewiſe will be flat and dull, and the Metal on the outſide may be eaſily raiſed to diſcover the defect.</p>
               <p>As for old moneys, the worſt ſize is the half Crowns with pieces of Copper plated over; and theſe you may know by their riſing in the middle falling hollow, Mackle in the ſtamp, or better by
