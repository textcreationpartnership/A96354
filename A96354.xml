            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>For drawing the face, general Rules,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>IN this ca≈øe curiou≈øly ob≈øerve the face in its motion, whether upward, forward, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or ≈øide-ways, touching lightly the features, where the Eyes, No≈øe, Mouth, and Chin ought to ≈øtand; then more perfectly go over them, for the Circles, Squares and Triangles, that are u≈øed in this matter, may ≈øerve well enough, to guide your Judgment where to place them. And in this ca≈øe, ob≈øerve diligently the principal Mu≈øcles of a Face, appearing mo≈øt in aged Men or Women. And there is u≈øual a threefold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153755:28"/>ob≈øerved in a Face, as fir≈øt from the top of the Fore-head to the Eye brows. Secondly, from the Brows to the bottom of the No≈øe, and Thirdly, from thence to the bottom of the Chin, but in ≈øome the Fore-head is lower, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the No≈øe longer.</p>
                  <p>The di≈øtances between the Eyes con≈øi≈øt in a full Face of the length of one Eye, but in a three quarter, or ≈øide-face, that di≈øtance is le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øened an≈øwerable to the proportion. As for the No≈øtril, it ought to be exactly placed again≈øt the corner of the Eye. And in a fat face, you will perceive the cheeks to ≈øwell, when on the contrary, in a lean face, the Jaw-bones ≈øtick out, and the cheeks fall in.</p>
                  <p>You may di≈øcern a ≈ømiling countenance, by perceiving the corners of the Mouth to turn up a little, and a frowning or ≈øowre countenance, by the Fore-heads bending and ≈øomewhat wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the top of the No≈øe.</p>
                  <p>To draw a fore-right Face, make the form of a perfect Oval, divided into three equal parts, by two Lines. In the fir≈øt part, place the Eyes: In the ≈øecond, the No≈øtrils: And in the third, the Mouth, ob≈øerving to keep the Eyes di≈øtant from each other, the length of one Eye, and that their inward corners be perfectly over the out ≈øide of the No≈øtrils.</p>
                  <p>To draw an upright head, it mu≈øt be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with three Lines, every way, either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, downwards, higher or lower, and that mu≈øt, as the former, be divided into three equal parts.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:153755:28"/>
                  <p>To draw the Inclining, or fore-≈øhortened face, ob≈øerve how the Lines concord or agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with ea≈øe, you may draw, in their proper places, the No≈øe, Mouth, and other parts, with a little Practice, and in the≈øe forms it is requi≈øite that you are very perfect as being rules of frequent u≈øe; for of the many parts of Man's Body, the face is mo≈øt difficult; but having got the true proportion, with your mea≈øures, you will be capable, let the face turn which way it will, to form it; and further note, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever proportion the Face you are to imitate bears, your out ≈øtroaks mu≈øt be formed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>As for the No≈øe, it requires to its due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion much care and diligence, as being the mo≈øt eminent part of the Face; in which, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ob≈øerve the hollowne≈øs, roundne≈øs, and indenting of the No≈øtrils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing, e≈øpecially where the body is to be covered, is to be con≈øidered of the Hands, in their ≈øeveral po≈øtures and po≈øitions, as well by mea≈øure, as without, as al≈øo Hands, and Arms of who≈øe po≈øtures, as well as the former, it would not be unnece≈ø≈øary for the Learner, to get draughts for his better imitation, which may be had at mo≈øt Picture Shops, for a ≈ømall matter ready done.</p>
                  <p>When you have practi≈øed, and are a little expert in drawing the Hands and Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the drawing of Feet in their ≈øeveral Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtures, as well without, as with mea≈øure;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153755:29"/>which having attained ≈øeparate, exerci≈øe your skill in drawing Legs and Feet conjunct or join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, that ≈øo under≈øtanding the frame and particulars of the whole body, you may be the better under≈øtanding in drawing the Figures in their due proportion and right Po≈øtures, in doing which there is no ≈ømall difficulty. And in this manner, having proceeded to form the Members, draw the other parts of the body, as the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Back, Brea≈øt, Belly, Secrets, Thighs, and the like, and la≈øtly take care in due proportion to join them, that they may appear firm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
                  <p>Coming to practi≈øe upon an entire body the be≈øt way is to begin with tho≈øe of Children; and my rea≈øon is, becau≈øe they are generally fat and plump, and rounder than the Bodies of Men and Women, and con≈øequently require ≈øo much curio≈øity in the ob≈øervation of Mu≈øcles and other Features, which render the drawing le≈øs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
                  <p>As for your further Direction in drawing, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve ever to begin at the Head, and ≈øo proceed by degrees, running the whole lightly over at the fir≈øt, and encrea≈øing more fully, as you ≈øee occa≈øion, ever being careful to take notice, that your parallel Joints, Mu≈øcles, Sinews, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be rightly proportioned, and exactly oppo≈øite; al≈øo that the motions of the Body be an≈øwerable to each other, and that the Parts and Limbs have a due Symmetry, not being faulty in the indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of having one great Arm or Leg, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153755:29"/>≈ømall one, nor a great Finger upon a ≈ømall Hand, neither further than the proportion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, ≈øuffer one Limb, or Member to be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than another; and although it ≈øo happen, which it frequently does, that at fir≈øt you commit Errors of this nature, yet be not di≈øcouraged, for frequent practice will redre≈øs them.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far proceeded with Succe≈øs, and being indi≈øterent perfect herein, you mu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider what it is to ≈øhadow; and in this ca≈øe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the following Rules, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The out Lines of the draught of any Picture, give the ≈øymmetry or proportion, which ought to be ≈øufficient to a good Judgment, but the Lines and Shadows produce to the le≈øs curious, the lively likene≈øs in ≈øhadowing; therefore of any Picture, you mu≈øt take notice to ca≈øt your ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow always one way, <hi>viz.</hi> on which ≈øide ≈øoever you begin to ≈øhadow your Figure, whether on the right or left Hand, as in the Figure of a Man, if you fir≈øt proceed to ≈øhadow his left Cheek, the left ≈øide of his Neck, Body, and all other parts mu≈øt be ≈øhadowed, unle≈øs the light ≈øide of the Figure be dark, by rea≈øon of ≈øome other Body ≈øtanding between the Light and it, as ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe three men were ≈øtanding together; then mu≈øt the Body, or Figure in the middle be dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the foremo≈øt, unle≈øs the light by facing it come between them.</p>
                  <p>Further, note, that all ≈øhadows mu≈øt con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grow fainter, as they are further remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the opacous Body from whence they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153755:30"/>proceed. But in ca≈øe of Storms, where Clouds, or Waves, by contending Winds are driven one again≈øt another, contrary ≈øhadows are allowed, as ≈øtriving for Superiority, and ≈øo you mu≈øt be ≈øure to ≈øupply the greate≈øt fir≈øt, and according to your Judgment, ≈øupply from them the le≈ø≈øer.</p>
                  <p>All circular Bodies mu≈øt have a circular ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as they have a circular form, and as the object of Light which cau≈øeth the ≈øhadow is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>And now for your further Information of this kind, ob≈øerve that a Man ≈øtanding from the top of the head, to the bottom of the feet, is in due proportion eight times the length of the Head. The Arm when it hangeth ≈øtraight down, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth within a ≈øpan of the Knee; the Hand mu≈øt be the length of the Face, and ≈øpread broad, mu≈øt cover it, and no more; and further note, that in drawing a Figure ≈øtanding, you mu≈øt in the fir≈øt place draw that Leg, which the Body ≈øtands firm upon, or el≈øe your Figure will unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently decline one way more than another, as if it were falling. The Arms of a Man extended are his full length; and ≈øo of a Woman in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particulars. Thus having directed you in the drawing and proportioning naked Figures, I now proceed to give directions about Garments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in naked Figures, it is ob≈øerved you draw the out-Lines fir≈øt; ≈øo you mu≈øt do in Drapery or Cloathing, leaving ≈øpace within for your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or le≈ø≈øer folds; then fir≈øt draw the greater folds, and break them into le≈ø≈øer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153755:30"/>contained within them, and the clo≈øer the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øits to the Body, the narrower and ≈ømaller mu≈øt be the folds, and in ≈øhadowing, the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt mu≈øt be the harder, and the outermo≈øt ≈øofter.</p>
                  <p>Continue always throughout your Garment the great folds, but as for the le≈ø≈øer, break them off, as you ≈øee convenient, and the finer your drapery is, the fuller, and ≈øharper mu≈øt your folds be, and the ≈øhadow the ≈øtronger, yet more plea≈øant to the Eye, ever taking notice, that that part of any Garment that ≈øits clo≈øe, as the body Coat of a Man, the Brea≈øts of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the like, mu≈øt not at all be folded, but rather with a ≈øweet ≈øhadow repre≈øent that part of the Body, that the Garment appears to cover, as Woman's Brea≈øts, with a ≈øweet found ≈øhadow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus much for the body of Man in drawing.</p>

               <p>If in any fair Landskip you expre≈øs the Light of the Sun, ever ob≈øerve, that throughout your whole Piece, you ca≈øt the Light of your Trees, Buildings, Rocks, Ruins, and all things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or expre≈øs'd within the work thither-ward: ob≈øerve further to le≈ø≈øen your Bodies proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, according to the nearne≈øs, or di≈øtance they ≈øhould naturally appear, ≈øo that the further the Landskip goeth from your Eye, the fainter you mu≈øt expre≈øs any thing ≈øeen at di≈øtance, till

               <p>To fit your ≈øelf, and prepare for the practice of this, you mu≈øt have Gums of all ≈øorts to make your waters as occa≈øion requires; al≈øo a Marble flat ≈øtone, a Muller, Colours of various forts, liquid Gold and Silver, Size to lay Gold,

               <p>To make your Gum-water take Gum-arabick, white, clear, or tran≈øparent, for that which is yellow, or of an Amber-Colour is in≈øignificant; tie up a quantity in a rag, and hang it in fair water, till it be di≈ø≈øolved; then the water being ≈øtiff enough for your purpo≈øe, mix your Colours with it, always having two ≈øorts to make a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker or ≈øtronger, as the matter requires.</p>
               <p>Gum-lake is a compound Gum, made of whites of Eggs, finely beat, Honey, Gum, of Ivy, ≈øtrong wort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being well mingled and beat together, they will run like Oil, and in the end harden, and this you may buy ready made, as the former, ob≈øerving only, that it be clear and tran≈øparent.</p>
               <p>As for the Colours, there are ≈øimply ≈øix, <hi>viz.</hi> white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue, to which ≈øome add browns, but they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally compounded, and of either of the≈øe, there are ≈øeveral ≈øorts, as the≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> Blacks the be≈øt, are burnt Ivory, Cherry-≈øtones, Lamp-black.

               <p>The Colours to be wa≈øhed are Bi≈øe-≈ømak, Cedar, Ultramarine, Ma≈øticote, and red Lead. The Sap-green is only to be ≈øteeped, and the re≈øt I have meationed are to be wa≈øhed and ground.</p>
               <p>To wa≈øh Colours, you mu≈øt put a quantity of the Colour intended into a clean earthen di≈øh, and pour water thereto very clear, ≈øtirring the Colour and water together, ≈øuffering it to ≈øtand a while, and perceiving the grea≈øe or ≈øcum to ri≈øe, take it off, and pour out that water, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting other water to the Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ≈øo do, till the water become clear, and the Colour at the bottom remain fine; then pour away the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gently, and you will find the Colour ≈øticking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ≈øides and edges of the di≈øh, as al≈øo at the bottom, and if it ≈øo happen, that you can get an ounce of pure Colour out of a pound (tho the re≈øt is ≈øerviceable for many u≈øes) it is ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>In ≈øteeping Sap-Green, you mu≈øt put it only into fair water, adding a fourth part of Alum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder to rai≈øe the Colour, and at the end of twenty four hours it will be a curious green.</p>
               <p>As for the Colours that are to be wa≈øhed and ground, take a ≈ømall quantity of either; and put it into a clean ≈øhell, adding a drop or two of Gum-water, and work it about the ≈øides of the ≈øhell with your finger, ≈øuffering it there to ≈øtick,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153755:33"/>till it is dry; then draw over it your Finger, and if any come off; then you mu≈øt add more Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, but being dry, if it glitter or ≈øhine, it is a token there is too much Gum in it, which you mu≈øt remedy, by tempering it up with fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only.</p>
               <p>There are ≈øome Colours, as Umber and Lake, which parch and crack when they are dry, and therefore to bind them, you mu≈øt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them with fine Sugar-Candy di≈ø≈øolved in fair water, and ≈øo you mu≈øt do by other hard Colours ≈øubject to this defect.</p>
               <p>To burn the Colour thereto appropriated, put them into a crucible, cover it with a Lid of Clay, and ≈øet it on a hot fire, and ≈øuffer it to be red hot, and when the Colour is cold, you may wa≈øh or grind it, as the Nature requires, but do neither before they be throughly burnt.</p>
               <p>To grind the Colours, I have directed ≈øo to be u≈øed, take a quantity of any of them clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed from dirt and filth, and laying it upon your ≈øtone, brui≈øe it a little with your Muller; and then with fair water grind it, till the Colour be very fine, then have in readine≈øs a large chalk ≈øtone with troughs, or furrows in it, and pour your Colour into it, and there ≈øuffer it to remain till it be well dry, at what time take it out, and re≈øerve it in Papers, or Boxes for your u≈øe‚Äî</p>
               <p>Of the≈øe ≈øix ≈øimple Colours, adding the brown, many may be compounded for faces of all Complexions, Garments, Land-skips, Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Rivers, Birds, Fi≈øh, Bea≈øts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As thus,</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:153755:33"/>
               <p>To make Violet Colour take Indico, white and Lake, and at plea≈øure, you may, as you take more or le≈øs of a Colour make it lighter, or darker at Plea≈øure.</p>
               <p>Lead Colour, you may make of Indico, and white mixed and tempered together.</p>
               <p>Make Flame Colour, or Colour for flaming Fire of red Lead and Ma≈øticote heightened with white.</p>
               <p>To make a ≈øcarlet Colour, take red Lead, Lake, and a ≈ømall quantity of Vermilion: For note, that the latter is not good in limning.</p>
               <p>To make light green, take Pink, and Smalt with white, to make it lighter, as occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHen you have prepared your Colours, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare likewi≈øe good Pencils, to know them, draw them wet through your Mouth, and if they come to a hair, or ≈øharp point, they are good, but if they after that ≈øtand rough, or hairs ≈øtare, or ≈øtart out at the ≈øide, they are nought, and to be rejected.</p>
               <p>The next thing is to prepare your Table; and in this ca≈øe, get a fine Pa≈øte-board ≈øleeked as ≈ømooth as a Card; then fine Parchment or Vellum, and ≈øtarch it upon the board, as ≈ømooth and even, that no wrinkle, or ri≈øing may appear; to perfect which, you mu≈øt lay the Parchment ≈øide on your Stone rubbed very clean, and poli≈øh the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øide, and ≈øo let it dry in the ≈øhade.</p>
               <p>Having thus prepared a Table, as big as you intend your Picture, chu≈øe a Light fair and large, free from ≈øhadow, being if po≈ø≈øible a Sky-light on the top of a hou≈øe, yet ≈øuch a one, as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams do not penetrate, or glance upon, ob≈øerving
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153755:34"/>to begin and end your work by one and the ≈øame light, keeping the room clean, that no du≈øt may fly about to prejudice your work.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be con≈øidered is your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ≈øitting; and in this ca≈øe, let your Desk be ≈øo placed, that when you ≈øit before it, your left Arm may be placed toward your light, and your right Arm from it, that your light may ≈ølaunt upon your work. And if you are to draw the Picture of any live Per≈øon, the po≈øture being agreed upon, ≈øuffer him or her to ≈øit above two yards di≈øtant from you, and as level with you as may be, marking well, that when≈øoever the Party moves, though never ≈øo little, for never ≈øo little motion of the Body or Face, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, may occa≈øion in a ≈øhort time many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and when you undertake this, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Materials are requi≈øite to be near you, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two ≈ømall di≈øhes or ≈øawcers with clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the one to wa≈øh your Pencils in when foul, and the other to tamper your Colours withal; a fine large Pencil to clean≈øe your work, called a Fitch-pencil; a ≈øharp Pen-knife to take off hairs, coming from your Pencil or Spots, that may fall upon your Card; a Paper having holes cut therein, to lay upon your Card, to cover it from du≈øt, and to re≈øt your Hand upon.</p>
               <p>If your Carnation, or fle≈øh Colour be temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, it mu≈øt be ≈øomewhat lighter, than the Complexion of the Party you are to draw. If it be a fair Complexion, you mu≈øt have white Lead, and red Lead well tampered. If the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153755:35"/>Complexion be ≈øwarthy or brown, add to your white and red Lead, Ma≈øticote, or Engli≈øh O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or both, if occa≈øion require it; but let the Complexion be what it will, be ≈øure to tamper your Fle≈øh Colour lighter than the Party to be drawn; for if it be too ≈øad, there is no remedy; and ob≈øerve to place your Shadows di≈øtinct from each other in a large ≈øhell: And note, that in all your Shadows, you mu≈øt u≈øe ≈øome white, wherefore in the fir≈øt place, lay a con≈øiderable quantity of white by it ≈øelf, over and above what the ≈øhadows are at fir≈øt tempered withal. In the ≈øecond place, for red u≈øual to the cheeks, and Lips, tamper Lake, and red Lead. In the third place, for your blue ≈øhadows, as Veins, or under the Eyes, take Indico and white. In the fourth place, for your fainti≈øh green ≈øhadow, take Engli≈øh Oker, White, and Indico, or ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Ma≈øticote. In the fifth place, for a deep ≈øhadow, take white, and Engli≈øh Oker, and Umber. Sixthly, for Dark ≈øhadows, in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Men, take Lake and Pink, for they make an excellent fle≈øhy ≈øhadow. And the≈øe being the chief ≈øhadows, I leave what may further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr of this kind to your di≈øcretion.</p>
               <p>Having all things in readine≈øs, the next thing you proceed to, is to draw the face, in doing which; take the following method, <hi>viz.</hi> lay the ground, with the Colour an≈øwerable to the Complexion of the Party; and then begin the draught, the Party ≈øitting. Now to fini≈øh a Face three Operations of ≈øitting are required. At
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153755:35"/>the fir≈øt ≈øitting, you mu≈øt only lay the dead Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour At the ≈øecond, go over the Face more curiou≈øly, nearly ob≈øerving what≈øoever may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Grace, or Deformity of the Per≈øon to be drawn, con≈øidering it in a ≈øweet di≈øpo≈øe, and well couching the Colours one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in this ≈øitting, you perfect what on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was rough before, by laying on the deep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, ≈øo that at the third ≈øitting, you may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the Face, as in the Eyes, Eye-brows, Hair, and Ears, which things are the la≈øt work, and not to be perfected, till the Hair, Curtain, or Back-≈øide of the Picture, as al≈øo the Drapery be fini≈øhed.

                  <p>Having laid your ground for the general Complexion, the next work mu≈øt be to draw the out Lines, which you mu≈øt effect with Lake, and white mingled drawing very faintly; ≈øo that if you chance to mi≈øs your proportion, you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it with a deeper mixture of the ≈øame Colour.</p>
                  <p>Having drawn the proportion of the Face, add to the former Colour a ≈ømall proportion of red Lead, tempering it faintly to the Colour of the Cheeks, and Lips, at the tips of the Chin, and Ears, about the Eyes, and the roots of the Hair, placing the red ≈øhadows, and as for the ≈øhadows, they mu≈øt not be put in with the flat of the Pencil, but with ≈ømall touches after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                  <p>Having duly placed, and proportioned your red ≈øhadows; in the next place, put in your faint blue ≈øhadows about the Corners of the Eyes, and Balls, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and your greyi≈øh blue under the Eyes, and about the Temples, working them ≈øweetly and faintly over by degrees, heightning the ≈øhadow, as the Light falls; as likewi≈øe the hard ≈øhadows in the dark ≈øide of the Face un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eye brows, No≈øe, Chin, and Neck, with ≈øome ≈øtronger touches on tho≈øe places, than on the light ≈øide of the Face, and ≈øo bring all your work together to an equal roundne≈øs, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perfection to no particular Part, at this time, but take a ful view of your object; and con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how near you hit the Life, not only in ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likene≈øs but roundne≈øs, boldne≈øs of Po≈øture, colouring, and ≈øuch like.

                  <head>The ≈øecond Operation or ≈øitting.</head>
                  <p>In this ≈øitting, the party mu≈øt take the ≈øame Place, and Po≈øture, as before, and then be curious to delineate with your Pencil, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular varieties of Nature; and as you drew them over but rudely before, you now mu≈øt ≈øweeten them with the ≈øame Colours, by working, and driving them one into another; ≈øo that no rough edge, nor lump of Colour may appear, and this mu≈øt be done, with a Pencil ≈øharper than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by which means the ≈øhadow may be ≈øoft and ≈ømooth.</p>
                  <p>Thus having done, proceed to the back-≈øide of your Picture, and if there a Curtain, as is the u≈øual manner, be required, we will ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe it to be blue Sattin, and to do it, temper as much Bi≈øe in a ≈øhell, as will cover a ≈ømall Card, ≈øuffering it to be moi≈øt and well bound with Gum; then draw with your Pencil the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of your Curtain, as al≈øo of your Picture, and ≈øo lay it over very thin, and airy with a large Pencil, that it may be the whole ground, you intend to do with blue; and then lay it over again with a ≈øub≈øtantial body of the ≈øame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; in doing which, you mu≈øt be ≈øwift, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Colour moi≈øt, and not ≈øuffering any part to be dry till all be covered.</p>

                  <p>If it happen that your Curtain is to be Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, you mu≈øt trace it out with Lake, and lay the ground with a thin Colour, ob≈øerving where your ≈øtrong Lights and Reflections fall, there lay the Lights with a thin, and wateri≈øh Colour, and the Ground being yet wet, lay the ≈øtrong and hard ≈øhadows clo≈øe by the other Lights, with a dark Colour temper'd rea≈øonably thick.</p>
                  <p>Thus having layed your back-≈øide, which in the ≈øame manner you may do with any Colour. Your next work is, to lay your Linen of a fair white, and your Drapery flat with the Colour you intend it. Then take another view of the Face, and mark well what ≈øhadows are too light, or too deep, and endeavour to reduce each ≈øhadow to its due Perfection; then ≈øhadow the enterance into the Ear, and draw the Lines of the Eye lid, the deepne≈øs of the Eye brows, and all the mo≈øt eminent Notes and Marks in the Face, doing them with a very curious ≈øharp Pencil, and then heighten the Hair, deepening it, as it appears in the Life, ca≈øting over the ground ≈øome loo≈øe Hairs, which will look very plea≈øant, and make the Picture ≈øeem to ≈øtand at ≈øome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance from the Curtain.</p>
                  <p>In the ≈øhadowing your Linen, which ought to be very curious, u≈øe black, white, a little yellow, and a ≈ømall quantity of blue. The black being deepened with Ivory-black; to which add a ≈ømall quantity of lake, or Indico: And thus much for the ≈øecond Operation, from whence I proceed to the third and la≈øt.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153755:41"/>over with a Knifes edge, not very ≈øharp, to take off the knots, if any appear, and ≈øo ≈øet your Frame and Cloth upon your Ey≈øel a convenient height, ≈øo that you ≈øitting upon a Stool level with the Party or Copy you draw, may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have the Picture equal, &amp;c. placing it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Light, as I have directed in Water-limning; then with a piece of Chalk draw the proportion of the Face upon the Cloth, making the place for the Eyes, No≈øe, Mouth, Ears, Hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then take a Swans Quill pointed Pencil, and begin with ≈øome of the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt Colours in the lighte≈øt part of the Face (the Cloth before being primed, or ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid) as the heightning of the Fore-head, Cheek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, No≈øe, &amp;c. on the lighte≈øt ≈øide, and when you have done that, next proceed to the mean parts, <hi>viz.</hi> tho≈øe not altogether ≈øo light, as the Cheek bone of the fore-≈øhortning, or dark ≈øide, the Chin and upper Lip and by degrees come to the redde≈øt part of all.</p>
               <p>Having thus far proceeded, lay the greeni≈øh faint ≈øhadows in places convenient, and where you ≈øee cau≈øe, to moderate the harder ≈øhadows; but have e≈øpecial regard not to place the green, where the red ≈øhould be: And ≈øo, all the faint, and light beginnings being put in, take a Ducks Quill fitch'd, and a Goo≈øe-Quill pointed Pencil, and begin at the Eyes to ≈øhadow with Lake, and trace out tho≈øe parts of the Face therewith, that require it, as the Eyes, No≈øe, Mouth, the compa≈øs of the Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153755:41"/>this before you lay on any Colour, lightly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it over with a linen rag, to prevent theover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of other Colours.</p>
               <p>Having now put in all the Colours, dark, and light, take a large fitched Pencil, and ≈øweeten the Colours: That is, go over the ≈øeveral ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows with a clean, ≈øoft Pencil, which by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and dexterous handling, will force, or drive the Colours into each other; ≈øo that they will repre≈øent the laying on at once, and not at ≈øeveral times. This being done, begin again with your clean Pencils of ≈øuch bigne≈øs, as the work requires; then, the Party ≈øitting in the po≈øture as before, take a curious view, and ≈øee what defects you find in the work, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them; after that proceed to heighten, or deepen your ≈øhadows, as the Nature of the piece requires, and if a Beard, or Hair be required, take a Goo≈øe Quill bri≈øtle Pencil, and put in the Hair about the Face, and rub in the greater Hair, with the greater Bri≈øtle, heightning it up with your Goo≈øe-quill Pencil, and ≈øo your work is done.</p>
               <p>If Garments are required, called by Arti≈øts Drapery, For a red Garment, lay dead Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with Vermilion, glaze it over with Lake, and heighten it with white.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153755:42"/>let all your deepenings be with black, Pink, and Lake well tempered. For green Garments, heighten Bi≈øe and Pink with Ma≈øticote, and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it with Indico and Pink.

               <p>For blue Garments, take Indico, and white, laying fir≈øt the white in its due Places; and then your mean Colour, <hi>viz.</hi> Indico, and white well tempered in their due places; then deepen it with Indico, and glaze it with Ultramarine when dry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>For purple Garments, take Oil ≈ømall temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Lake, and white Lead, and heighten it with the latter.</p>
               <p>For black Garments, let the dead Colour be Lamp-black, and a little Verdegrea≈øe, and when it is dry, go over it with Ivory-black, and having heightned it with white, go over it with Ivory black, and Verdegrea≈øe.</p>
               <p>For Orange Colour Garments, mix red Lead, and Lake, laying the lighte≈øt parts with red Lead, and white; the mean parts with only red Lead, and the deeper with Lake, and if need requires you may heighten it with white.</p>

               <p>In preparing your Copper, ob≈øerve that it be well poli≈øhed, not lying higher in one place than another, nor no where uneven, and if you e≈øpy and ≈øpecks or di≈øorders in it, coal it over with a well burnt Char-coal, and fair water, and ≈øet it a≈ølope to dry, which done, ≈øcrape ≈øome very dry Chalk or Whitening upon it, and rub it over with a woollen rag, not touching the Face of the Plate with your finger, till the ground be laid, which mu≈øt be done in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>In the fir≈øt place, be ≈øure to choo≈øe a good Oil ≈øtone free from pin-holes, or flaws, not too hard, nor too ≈øoft; and therefore the better to furni≈øh your ≈øelf aright, you mu≈øt con≈øult, in what the ≈øtre≈øs of your bu≈øine≈øs will lie; for if you intend Picture, or Letter work, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more curious than Marks, or Arms u≈øed by Gold-≈ømiths, and Pewterers, you mu≈øt have your Gravers accordingly ≈øhaped, and tempered, for Gold-≈ømiths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gravers are frequently crooked, the better to come at hollow places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for Copper, or any Plate, that may be ea≈øily come at, the ≈øtrait Gravers are ever held the be≈øt, and if you ≈øu≈øpect their goodne≈øs, try whether, or not, they are file proof; and if ≈øo, they will fit your purpo≈øe, though at fir≈øt, by rea≈øon of their temper, they may appear brittle, and ≈øometimes break ≈øhort, yet being ground out, they will ≈øtill grow better and better, and come in a little time to an excellent temper.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:153755:45"/>your ≈øtroaks, or hatches more graceful, and yet carry with them ≈øufficient force and vigor.</p>
               <p>In ca≈øe of whetting your Gravers, which is frequently required, pour a little fine Olive Oil upon your ≈øtone, and laying that ≈øide, which you intend ≈øhall cut the Copper flat upon it, whet it very flat, and even, and to that purpo≈øe, carry your hand very ≈øteady, continuing an equal ≈øtrength, and placing your fore finger firm upon the contrary ≈øide, ≈øo that you may have more power to guide it with exactne≈øs; then turn the unwhetted ≈øide, and u≈øe it in the ≈øame form and manner, that there may be a very ≈øharp edge; then turning uppermo≈øt that edge, which in the former manner you have whetted, ≈øetting the end of your Graver obliquely upon the ≈øtone, bear your hand with an exact evenne≈øs, to the intent it may prove very flat, and ≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Further to fix you in this affair, you mu≈øt have a ≈øtrong round Cu≈øhion of Leather filled with fine Sand, about half a foot over, and four inches in the Diameter, ri≈øing a little in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and ≈øloping towards the brims, but not much, and this mu≈øt be to lay your Plate on, that you may turn it at lei≈øure; and if you are to make ≈øtreight ≈øtroaks, hold your Graver in a direct Line: Or in ca≈øe you would have your ≈øtroaks broader, and deeper in one place than in another, you mu≈øt lay more or le≈øs ≈øtre≈øs, as you ≈øee occa≈øion, ob≈øerving in all ≈øtreight ≈øtroaks, to hold your Plate ≈øteady, and firm upon the Cu≈øhion, and the Table, or Bank on which it ≈øtands well fixed: But in crooked, and winding ≈øtroaks, you mu≈øt hold your Hand, and Graver ≈øteadfa≈øt, and only turn your Plate, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways you cannot command your Hand to that neatne≈øs, as in many ca≈øes is required, ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:153755:46"/>at the ≈øame time, for the more ≈øteadine≈øs to keep your Elbow fixed upon the Table, and your Eye on the Plate, ≈øcraping your work, as you go with the edge of a burni≈øher to take off the roughne≈øs; yet be careful that you make no ≈øcratches, and the better to ≈øee what you have done, rub the place over with a piece of black felt dipped in Oil; and then if any ≈øcratches ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, with your burni≈øher rub them out, and if any ≈øtroaks be too hard, in the ≈øame manner you may make them fainter. And in ca≈øe your Graver ≈øhould happen to appear very hard, which by its exce≈ø≈øive brittlene≈øs in often breaking is known, lay it upon a burning Charcoal, till it grow yellow; and then dip it in water, and it will by often ≈øo doing render it of a better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but if it be blunt in a ≈øhort time cutting, then it is too ≈øoft, and you mu≈øt heat it in the fire, and dip it in Lime juice, or Vinegar: And thus much for the management of the Tools. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the which by a little practice will ≈øoon grow natural.</p>
               <p>Another material thing in Art is to be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; which is, to take the Impre≈ø≈øion you are to cut, or grave upon your Plate; and in this ca≈øe, heat your Plate over a fire of Small-coal, and having a piece of fine Bees-wax tyed up in a fine rag, worked like a ball, that it may ≈øit clo≈øe, wipe the Plate over with it, when it is hot enough, very lightly, till you perceive it is covered with wax, very thin, and even, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a feather, in which, at fir≈øt you may find ≈øome difficulty, but u≈øe will render it ea≈øie,

               <p>The carrying of the hand in this kind, will at fir≈øt ≈øeem difficult, as to the depth of your ≈øtroaks; but in general, ob≈øerve ever to carry your hand with ≈øuch a ≈ølight, that you may end with the ≈øame faintne≈øs, or darkne≈øs you begin: And in ca≈øe, one part require more deepne≈øs, and blackne≈øs than another, you mu≈øt do that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and that you may the more expertly do it, ob≈øerve that your ≈øtroaks be not too clo≈øe, nor too wide; and therefore to bring your hand in the better, practi≈øe at fir≈øt by ≈øuch Prints, as are but loo≈øly ≈øhadowed, lea≈øt by attempting to imitate tho≈øe more dark and clo≈øe, you happen to be puzzled where to begin, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:153755:47"/>where to end, but practice will inform you.</p>
               <p>As for Letters; in ca≈øe of Copies, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters mu≈øt be gone over with ungumed Ink, or with black Lead, and laid on the Plate when waxed as the former, unle≈øs you are ≈øo dexterous at writing, that you can draw them by hand, or with a ≈øteel point on the Plate in true Cut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>IN ca≈øe of Minerals, and all things inanimate, concenter'd, or contained in the Bowels of the Earth, it is convenient to reduce them to four kinds of Mixtures, viz.

                  </gap>her, and here by Earth. I mean the ≈øimple Element only, of which, as the Philo≈øophers affirm, all ≈øublunary Bodies are compounded, and though the Earth,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153755:53"/>according to the ≈øituations of Countries, and differences of Climes, differs in Scent, Colour and Ta≈øte; yet that proceeds from a mixture of ≈øome other part, or effect of the former; the pure Elementary Earth being in all places one and the ≈øame; in which, and by the operation of heat and moi≈øture, the others are generated; and as there are more or le≈øs of the≈øe, the Metals are finer or cour≈øer: But to come nearer to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe.</p>
               <p>Gold is found in Grains, or Sand; and Silver in veins, and ≈øometimes twi≈øted, and wreathed like the branches of a Vine, and at other times the≈øe Metals are found in ≈øtones, with who≈øe hardne≈øs, they have incorporated them≈øelves, and being broken, are with fining materials ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. As for Gold; it is the mo≈øt perfect of all inanimate bodies, and has its Generation, as I have ≈øaid from heat, and moi≈øture in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; but of Parts ≈øo well contracted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by Concoction, that it is in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, it being beyond the Power of any Element to prejudice, or de≈øtroy it; for the Fire of the mo≈øt ≈øubtle, and piercing Quality, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming all other Metals by long Application, renders Gold more pure, nor can the Air, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Earth dimini≈øh its lu≈øter; but that it will again recover it, by which means, it has de≈øerved the E≈øtimation the World affords it; and is ≈øo ductil, that being expanded, an ounce of pure Gold will cover a place of twenty, or thirty feet ≈øquare.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:153755:54"/>
               <p>Silver as is hinted, carries a finene≈øs next to Gold, wanting little more than the Colour, to be brought to its perfection; wherefore tho≈øe that ≈øtrongly inveigh again≈øt the tran≈ømutation of Metals, have been convinced, that there is a po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibility to turn Silver into Gold, by rea≈øon Fire and artificial concoctions may ≈øupply the defect, of which there have been many Experiments, and from the even mixture, good temperature, and finene≈øs of its parts, it is not only ductil, and malleable, but endures the Fire with little wa≈øte, and admirable it is, that an ounce of fine Silver may be drawn out into a thou≈øand four hundred yards, and that too, for the mo≈øt part without breaking; and all this exten≈øion may be gilded with ≈øix grains of Gold.</p>
               <p>Copper is a metal to the compo≈øition whereof, a great quantity of Sulphur is required, and from a di≈øtempered heat in the mixture, the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heat proceeds, and being over burnt in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition, it is therefore le≈øs ≈øubject to Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and is u≈øed about Engines of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, becau≈øe it ru≈øteth not, and is found in Mineral Stones of divers colours, though the mo≈øt effectual Colour is green, or blue, and ≈øo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is it ingendred near Gold, and Silver, that many times following a vein of it, much pure Gold, and oftener Silver has been found; and ≈øuch Veins of Copper, as make a ≈øuperficial ≈øhew, are upon being digged, richer the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per you go, and that is occa≈øioned by the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture; and many times pure Silver is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Iron though very common, which le≈ø≈øens its e≈øteem, and may be termed the Wall, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of Kingdoms the ≈øafe-Guard of private Per≈øons and the Handy craft Trad≈ø-man's only <hi>unum nece≈ø≈øarium,</hi> for without it few Imployments can ≈øub≈øi≈øt. As for its extraordinary hardne≈øs from over much Earthy parts, or fixed Sulphur in its compo≈øition; not, but it has a proportion of Quick ≈øilver in it, ≈øo that it will not without a very violent heat be melted, nor will it break, but expand by force of hammers, or other Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and receive an impre≈ø≈øion by dilating it ≈øelf; and although it is cold and dry, yet by rea≈øon it is more porous than other Metals, it is of le≈øs weight; and con≈øequently ≈øubject to be con≈øumed by ru≈øt.</p>
               <p>Lead is frequently found in the Silver Mines, and indeed as often by it ≈øelf, nor ≈øcarcely is there any ore, but ≈øome quantity of Lead is found in its mixture, as being by the abundance of its humidity ≈øerviceable to it; and e≈øpecially in the melting of Gold, and Silver, which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be done without the help of Lead; for in this ca≈øe, by rea≈øon of its moi≈øture, it does ea≈øily evaporate, carrying with it whatever is not Gold, or Silver, and in its weight comes neare≈øt to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Gold, and in Colour to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not being ≈øubject to Corruption, as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
               <p>Tin is begotten, or generated by a gro≈ø≈øer fore of indige≈øted Quick ≈øilver, though much finer than Lead, by which means, it becomes more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:153755:55"/>white, and hard, though from the ill mixture of its ≈øub≈øtance, it is accounted the Bane of Metals making them brittle by never ≈øo ≈ømall a mixture; and the rea≈øon is, that by its incorporation, it hinders the ductility, and di≈øorders its former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual temperature; except in Lead, with which it better agrees, by rea≈øon of the moi≈øture, and ≈øoftne≈øs; ≈øo that being incorporated they become ductil, and malleable.</p>
               <p>Quick-≈øilver is of a liquid penetrating Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, and greatly in u≈øe; e≈øpecially in refining Metals, agreeing with any ≈øort, abounding with much humidity; which gives it brightne≈øs and weight, and is held the principal of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all Metals; nay its very ≈øub≈øtance is tran≈ømutable into Metals, enduring as well, as tho≈øe that come out of the Mines, the trial of the Fire, and Hammer.</p>
               <p>There are ≈øundry Metals, called Artificial Metals, made by mixture of Minerals.
